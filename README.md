# tv-script-generation
Project from Udacity's course: Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation (https://br.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101/)

This project generates a Simpsons TV script using RNNs using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
